## Overview
Although we are living in the 21st century with enormous technological and industrial developments, many people and economies are suffering from a shortage of freshwater. This project aims at addressing the lack of freshwater in vulnerable areas by raising donations, encouraging more academic research in this field, providing policymakers with potential solutions, and absorbing valuable members and volunteers. 
 
## Description
We tried to design this project with concise content and a direct message. The pages are highly responsive and work on different devices.

## UX
 
This website belongs to the philanthropic and non-profit organization named WSAF (Water Scarcity Action Force).

### External users’ goal:
The site users are divided into two groups:
-	People who are willing to contribute to combating climate change effects. They reach their goal by donating money or doing volunteering jobs via this website.
-	Researchers, scientists, and job seekers in environmental fields. They achieve their goals by applying for the available positions and vacancies.

### Site owners’ goal:
The WaSAF organization is interested in raising donations and absorbing volunteers and members to carry out their environmental and conservation projects. The final goal is addressing the water scarcity problems.

## Features

### Navigation Bar
All pages have a fixed navigation bar on top of the page that can be accessed throughout the entire page, and users can go to their desired page at any time. The navigation bar collapses on small screen devices (tablets and cell phones) and works as a toggler, and also the logo of the company changes to its acronym. Moreover, by clicking on the name (or logo) of the company, users can navigate to the Home page.
 
### Home Page
- The Home page contains an overlay (blurred) image in its header with the company purposes and slogans sharper on the right side. The company slogans disappear on smaller screens (only on medium and large screens).
- Completed field projects: Photos of the successful projects in Asia and Africa are shown on a section with image captions with brief description.
- Research topics: The pictures and the main topics and a short description of the research conducted in different case studies are shown in the next section.

### vacancies Page
- Vacancies’ announcement: A list of available jobs and volunteering positions and the corresponding application process. We used a table to list the jobs that the color of the rows of the table change by hovering on them.

### Your Contribution (donation) Page
- This page contains different ways that users can donate money to the WSAF.

### Contact Page
- Contact information: Provide users with the WSAF's social media and contact information.
- There is aslo a form that users can directly type there message.

### footer
- Raising money: Adding a “Donation” section that navigate to the Your Contribution page.
- Raising money: Adding a “How to contribute” section that navigate to the Vacancies page.
- The contact info of the WSAF

### Features Left to Implement
- Providing a direct payment terminal
- the form in contact page should include an id to save the messages
- Providing each project with a separate page containing more details
- providing a page for the upcoming projects

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
